# Basic Astrology Symbol Lookup
---
## What is it for?

This tool was designed to provide an easy way for a user to look up their astrological symbol by entering their month and day of birth.

## What does it do?

When a user enters their date of birth, a script will run and insert the result into a paragraph element below the inputs. Later iterations include/will include the ability for users who already know their sign to click on an image of the corresponding symbol to display a result.

## How is it built?

I built the tool using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
